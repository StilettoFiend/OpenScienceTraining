OpenScienceTraining
===================

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Open Science Training Initiative!

**** PLEASE NOTE: All OSTI slide decks are now available. Keep checking back for updates and new materials: we'll be adding Guidance Notes to accompany each slide deck in the near future ****

The Open Science Training Initiative (OSTI) provides a series of lectures on topics in data management and open science, designed to sit over existing taught courses in any area of the sciences. All course materials carry a CC-BY licence, so you're free to take the slides (or indeed a subset of them) and modify them to suit your own requirements, as long as you provide an attribution to the original authors.

Brief descriptions of the course materials will appear below as files are added to this repo. If you have any questions about OSTI or the materials supplied here (i.e. not queries relating to the use of, or problems with, GitHub), please email *enquiries[at]opensciencetraining.com*

CORE LECTURES:
--------------
*Introduction: Reproducibility and Open Science*
(Divided into two sets of lecture slides: 1A introduces the themes of openness and reproducibility, while 1B explains how Rotation Based Learning works.)

- `Lecture1A-OpenAndRepro-beta` is a slide deck for the first half of the OSTI opening lecture. Content provides a broad introduction to the nature and benefits of openness in scientific research, as well as current examples of open practice. PLEASE NOTE THAT LECTURE 1A IS CURRENTLY SUPPLIED IN BETA VERSION: additional images and embedded videos will appear in updated versions.

- `Lecture1B-RotationOutline` is a slide deck for the second half of the opening lecture and is supplied in both .ODP and .PPTX formats. These slides assist the lecturer in explaining how Rotation Based Learning works; ready-formatted slides are included for listing of student work groups, lecture times and deadlines.

- `ExampleRotationHandout` is a text document handout intended as a handout for the OSTI student cohort; it is supplied in two formats: .ODT and .DOCX. Although the version supplied refers to GitHub, this is by no means an essential and course leaders may choose to use their preferred project hoster.

- `Lecture1-GuidanceNotes` will be uploaded shortly. These are not intended as a script, but instead provide a set of advice notes for prospective lecturers/course leaders, along with other links and sources of information on reproducibility and open science.

*Code, Content and Data Licensing*

- `Lecture2-Licensing` is a slide deck providing an introduction to the three main categories of licensing in scientific work: Code, Content and Data. This lecture is provided in both .ODP and .PPTX formats.

- `Lecture2-GuidanceNotes` will be uploaded shortly.

*Open Access Publishing*

- `Lecture3-Publishing` is a slide deck designed to provide a basic introduction to academic publication. The presentation includes schematics for use in describing the "traditional" model of science publishing, as well as Green and Gold formats. This slide deck is provided in both .ODP and .PPTX formats.


ENHANCEMENT LECTURES and/or PRACTICAL SEMINARS:
------------------------------------------------
*Version Control*

- `Supp1-VersionControl` is a slide deck providing a brief introduction to version control, and is supplied in both .ODP and .PPTX formats. Please note that this is NOT intended for use as a stand alone lecture, but is designed for use as part of a hands-on workshop in Version Control and GitHub. Accompanying workshop materials to follow soon.

*Data Management Plans*

- `Supp2-DMPs` is a slide deck designed to introduce students to Data Management Planning. Starting from an overview of the scale and scope of modern scientific data, the slides motivate the need for DMPs in research and take students through the short-, medium- and long-term steps for producing a plan and carrying it out. Please note that these slides are NOT designed for use as a stand-alone lecture, but are meant to form part of a hands-on mini-workshop. Exercises and practical materials to follow soon.

*The Work of the Open Knowledge Foundation*
